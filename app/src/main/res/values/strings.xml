    <string name="tnx_overview">The Trust Nexus (TNX) is an open source ecosystem that provides cryptographically secure mobile identity.
                                \n
                                \nThe ecosystem has two components:
                                \n
                                \n    TNX Mobile Application (\"WebAuthn+\")
                                \n    TNX Web Application
                                \n
                                \nThe source code and licensing details can be found at www.tnxsecure.com.
                                \n
                                \nA security system is truly secure if the detailed plans of the system are known and the bad actors can still not break in.
                                \n
                                \nWith every line of the source code available and with only one known exploit***, the Trust Nexus (TNX) is a highly secure
                                  identity ecosystem that is incredibly easy to use.
                                \n
                                \nThe license has restrictions.  The most important restriction is that the API allowing anyone to add
                                  a credential to the TNX Mobile Application must be maintained.
                                \n
                                \nThe license is free for authenticating external users (e.g., banking customers);
                                  there is an annual per user license fee for internal authentication (e.g., banking employees).
                                \n
                                \n***The only known exploit occurs when someone looks over your shoulder, steals your password,
                                  then steals your phone and signs on before you can report your phone stolen.
                                \n

        License Highlights
        \n
        \nThe key restriction of the license is that the source code can only be reposted to a public repository if the copyright and license notice is maintained in each and every file.
        \n
        \nOur technology is completely FREE for every publicly facing website for general user authentication.  There is a licensing fee for corporations and government agencies for internal authentication (e.g., free for banking customers; a small annual fee for banking employees).
        \n
        \nOur technology is completely FREE for any business organization with less than 1,000 employees.
        \n
        \nOur technology is completely FREE for all colleges and universities.  We hope that our open source project will be used in teaching.
        \n
        \nOur technology for encrypting data on a mobile device is completely FREE for everyone.  Everyone who cares about secure data on mobile devices should implement our technology.
        \n
        \nThe only organizations that are required to pay a license fee are business organizations with 1,000 or more employees, government agencies and organizations running an authentication service (the annual license fee must be paid for each uesr of the service).
        \n
        \nThe license allows resellers to integrate WebAuthn+ into customized solutions (with source code as long as the copyright and license notice is maintained).  Resellers must act as agents and collect the license fees.
        \n
        \nYou are not required to give modifications back to the project, although (of course) quality modifications are welcome.
        \n
        \nThe cost of an annual user license is 1 IVY Unit, 1/1,000 of an ounce of gold (currently about $1.51 USD).
        \n
        \nWe plan to create a program that will compensate core developers who contribute to the open source effort.
        \n
        \nLicense Details
        \n
        \nPLEASE READ THIS END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT ("LICENSE") CAREFULLY BEFORE CLICKING THE "ACCEPT" BUTTON OR DOWNLOADING OR USING THE TNX WEBAUTHN+ MOBILE/WEB APPLICATION ("APPLICATION") ACCOMPANYING THIS LICENSE.
        \n
        \nBY CLICKING THE "ACCEPT" BUTTON OR DOWNLOADING OR USING THE APPLICATION, YOU ARE ENTERING INTO AND AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE.

        \n
        \n2. License Grant and Restrictions on Use.
        \n
        \n2.1 License Grant. Company grants You a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited right to install and use the Application on multiple Mobile Devices and multiple web servers, and to access and use the Application strictly in accordance with the terms and conditions of this License, the Usage Rules and any service agreements associated with your Mobile Device (collectively "Related Agreements").

        \n3.1 Rights to Application. You acknowledge and agree that the Application and all copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights associated therewith are, and shall remain, the property of Company.

        \n
        \n3.2 Third Party Software. The Application may utilize or include third party software that is subject to open source and third party license terms ("Third Party Software"). You acknowledge and agree that Your right to use such Third Party Software as part of the Application is subject to and governed by the terms and conditions of the open source or third party license applicable to such Third Party Software, including, without limitation, any applicable acknowledgements, license terms and disclaimers contained therein.

        \n
        \n4. Restriction on Transfer. You may not rent, lease, lend, sublicense or transfer the Application, this License or any of the rights granted hereunder without collecting or paying specified license fees. Any attempted transfer in contravention of this provision shall be null and void and of no force or effect.
        \n
        \n5. License Fees. Any organization utilizing the Application is required to pay license fees.
        \n
        \n5.1 The Application is completely FREE for every publicly facing website for general user authentication. There will be licensing fees for corporations and government agencies for internal authentication (e.g., free for banking customers; a small annual fee for banking employees).
        \n
        \n5.2 The Application is completely FREE for any business organization with less than 1,000 employees.
        \n
        \n5.3 The Application is completely FREE for all colleges and universities. We hope that our open source project will be used in teaching.
        \n
        \n5.4 Our technology for encrypting data on a mobile device is completely FREE for everyone. Everyone who cares about secure data on mobile devices should implement our technology.
        \n
        \n5.5 The only organizations that are required to pay a license fee are business organizations with 1,000 or more employees, government agencies and organizations running an authentication service (the annual license fee must be paid for each uesr of the service).
        \n
        \n5.6 An IVY Unit is a cryptographic token backed by 1/1,000 of an ounce of gold (currently about $1.51 USD).
        \n
        \n5.7 The cost of an annual user license is one IVY Unit, currently about $1.51 USD (that is a little more than twelve cents per internal user per month). So if a federal agency with 10,000 employees (and millions of external users) licenses the platform, the annual license cost would be $15,100.
        \n
        \n5.8 There is an organizational cap on the license cost: 100,000 IVY Units. If a major bank with 250,000 employees (and millions of external users) licenses the platform, the annual cost would be $151,000 (about the cost of one good software developer).
        \n
        \n5.9 This license allows resellers to integrate WebAuthn+ into customized solutions. Resellers must act as agents and collect the license fees.
        \n
        \n5.10 Any organization or government agency using the technology of the Trust Nexus for fiancial transactions or funds transfers must pay an annual license fee of one IVY Unit, currently about $1.51 USD, for each one million dollars in transactions/transfers ($1.51/$1,000,000 = 0.00000151  or 0.0151 BPS  or 1.51 cents per $10,000); this rate is thousands of times lower than the current fees for financial transactions or funds transfers.  For currencies other than the USD, corresponding fees based on current exchange rates will apply.
        \n
        \n6. Term and Termination.
        \n
        \n6.1 Term. This License shall be effective in perpetuity.
        \n
        \n6.2 Termination. Once granted it may never be revoked or modified if the licensee complies with the license and terms of payment. If You fail to comply with any terms and conditions of this License, then this License and any rights afforded to You here under shall terminate automatically, without any notice or other action by Company.
